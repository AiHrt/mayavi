Making a release
-----------------

Updating the docs for the release
..................................

* Update the docs images (you need a _working_ version of Mayavi for
  this):

    cd docs/source
    python render_images.py

* Update the docs themselves (this will also check them in svn)

    python setup.py dist_docs -c

* Publish the docs for this release on the web (Be careful to change the
  release number at the end of the URL)

   python setup.py dist_docs -u -t https://svn.enthought.com/svn/cec/trunk/projects/Mayavi/docs/3.0.3

How the automatic doc references are generated
----------------------------------------------

The automatic references for mlab are generated using the
mlab_reference.py script in the root directory. This script defines a
class to explore a module and generate rest files for documentation. In
particular, it looks for example code in test functions and resulting
images.
