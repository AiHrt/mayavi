5 July, 2008 (PR):
    - ENH: All the envisage menus and actions for sources, filters and
      modules now are autogenerated from the metadata for these. 
    - NEW/API: [19458] adds the following features:
        - A Registry (enthought.mayavi.core.registry.Registry) to
          register engines, sources, filters and modules. Source, filter
          and module metadata is registered and this can be used to do
          various things like generate menus, register data file
          extension handlers and whatnot. The metadata related classes
          are in enthought.mayavi.core.metadata.
        - This registry and metadata information is used to generate the
          envisage menus and actions.
        - The registry can be used by users to register new sources,
          readers, filters and modules.
        - A method to Engine and Script to easily open any supported
          data file.
        - Simplify the open file interface so it is just one menu item
          that supports different file extensions.
        - Changed the command line options for the mayavi2 application
          so you can open *any* supported data file format with the -d
          option.  This breaks backwards compatibility but makes it very
          easy to open supported data files -- even if the new ones are
          added by users.
        - Fixed the PLOT3DReader so it opens the q file using the xyz
          filenames basename. 

29 June, 2008 (GV): 
    - ENH: Updated Sphinx docs [19318]. 
    - ENH: New splash screen [19319].
    - ENH: mlab now works with envisage, including in "mayavi2 -x"
      [19321] [19323]


27 June, 2008 (Vibha):
    - API: Remove SimpleScene class [19285].
    - API: Moved tvtk-related examples from TraitsGUI to Mayavi [19191]
      [19197] [19231] [19280]

27 June, 2008 (GV):
    - BUG: tvtk: proper handling of non-float numpy arrays. Added test
      case [19297]

25 June, 2008 (GV):
   - ENH: Add autoscale to mlab.surf (scalez keyword argument) [19131]
   - ENH: mlab.usrf and mlab.mesh can now take x and y arguments with a
     more flexible shape [19114].

12 June, 2008 (PR):
    - ENH: Adding an offscreen option to the mayavi2 application.  This
      lets you run a normal mayavi Python script in offscreen mode
      without the full UI.  This is very convenient when you want to
      render a huge number of images from a visualization and don't want
      the UI to bother you or create a special script for the purpose.
      See [18951], [18955].

07, 08 June, 2008 (PR):
    - API: TVTK: Added two methods `setup_observers` and
      `teardown_observers` that let one turn on/off the observer for the
      ModifiedEvent fired on each VTK object that a TVTK object wraps to
      keep the traits updated.  Thus, if you call `teardown_observers`
      the traits will not be automatically updated if the wrapped VTK
      object is changed.  This can be manually updated by calling the
      `update_traits` method.  It is OK to call the
      setup/teardown_observers method as often as needed.  This is also
      tested.  See [18885].
    - API: TVTK: Removed the `__del__` method on all TVTK objects.  This
      should make it much nicer for proper garbage collection.  See
      [18886], [18887].

06 June, 2008 (PR):
    - TEST: Added a standalone mode to the tests so you can test without
      starting up the envisage app.  Envisage imports may be required
      however.  To use this run any test with the -s option. [18880]
    - TEST: Added a way to run the tests on one application launch
      instead of starting mayavi each time.  To use this execute run.py
      with the --one-shot command line option.  [18880] [18881].
    - TEST: The standalone offscreen mode now should work without a
      single Traits UI showing up with just a dummy blank window being
      used.  This demonstrates how mayavi scripts can work in completely
      different contexts.  [18881].
      

31 May, 2008 (PR):
    - PORT: Backported important additions to the 2.2.0 branch.
    - BUG: Added a test case for the hide/show functionality and fixed
      known bugs.
    - API: Adding elementary support for texturing an actor (if it has
      texture coords).  This was thanks to a patch from Chandrashekhar
      Kaushik. [18827]

30 May, 2008 (PR):
    - API: Adding closing, closed lifecycle events to the scene [18806].

27 May, 2008 (PR):
    - NEW: Adding a Labels module to label input data.  This is like
      MayaVi1's module and with this checkin all important mayavi1
      modules and filters are supported in mayavi2.  The only missing
      one is Locator which hardly anyone uses I think.  See [18801].

27 May, 2008 (PR):
    - NEW: Adding an ImageDataProbe filter which does the same thing
      that MayaVi-1.5's StructuredPointsProbe does. [18792]

25 May, 2008 (PR):
    - NEW: Adding CellDerivatives and Vorticity filters. [18785]

24 May, 2008 (PR):
    - NEW: Adding a tvtk_doc.py module that doubles as a
      TVTK Class/Filter/Source/Sink chooser and also as a documentation
      browser (with search!) like Mayavi1.x's vtk_doc.py.  tvtk_doc is
      also installed as a console script now. [18776]
    - NEW: Adding a UserDefined filter where the user can wrap around
      any TVTK filter. [18780]

23 May, 2008 (PR):
    - NEW: SetActiveAttribute filter that lets you select the active
      attribute.  This makes it very easy to find the contours of one
      scalar on the iso-contour of another.  The example
      contour_contour.py shows how this is done.  See [18774], [18775].

22 May, 2008 (PR):
    - NEW: Adding Contour and CutPlane filters that use the Wrapper
      filter and respective components.  This is very convenient.
    - Checked in modified patch from Chandrashekhar Kaushik (CSE IITB),
      which reimplements hide/show using a visible trait.


21 May, 2008 (PR):
    - TEST: Adding an @test decorator to make it easy to create a mayavi
      test case from a mayavi script.  While this is convenient, I still
      prefer to explicitly use the TestCase class since this makes the
      code compatible with the 2.2.0 branch.
    - The GenericModule is now tested.

20 May, 2008 (PR):
    - NEW: Adding a GenericModule to easily put together a bunch of
      Filters and Components.  Using this code it takes 30 simple
      lines of code for a ScalarCutPlane compared to the 300 complex
      ones we need for the current implementation!  This is because the
      module takes care of all the dirty work.
    - NEW: Adding Wrapper, Optional and Collection filters that make it
      easy to wrap around existing Components and Filters, make them
      optional and create collections of them very easily.  This gives
      us a great deal of reuse and makes it very easy to create new
      filters.

18 May, 2008 (PR):
    - ENH: Improved the PLOT3D reader and added a test for it.
    - Added a menu item to allow a user to run a Python script from the
      UI.
    - API: Added a close method to
      `enthought.pyface.tvtk.tvtk_scene.TVTKScene`.  This class is
      inherited by all Scenes (DecoratedScene and Scene).  The close
      method shuts down the scene properly.  This should hopefully
      prevent async errors when closing editors/windows containing
      scenes.  See [18708].
    - Updated the scene plugin, scene_editor (TraitsBackend*),
      actor_editor and the ivtk code to use the close method.
    - TEST: All the tests run on the trunk and pass when the offscreen
      option is used (which was also added).

17 May, 2008 (PR):
    - NEW: Adding an SelectOutput filter that should address bug number
      478359 in the Debian BTS.  See [18700].
    - API: enthought.mayavi.plugins.app.Mayavi now defines a
      setup_logger method so this can be overridden by subclasses, see
      [18703].
    
13 May, 2008 (PR):
    - NEW: Adding an ExtractVectorComponents filter contributed by Varun
      Hiremath.

11,12 May 2008 (PR):
    - ENH/API: The plugins now start the engine themselves and also do
      the binding to the shell. Earlier this was done by the
      application.  This makes the plugins reusable. Also added a
      running trait to the engine to check on its status. [18672],
      [18678]. 
    - At this point all examples in trunk work save the mayavi_custom_ui
      plugin stuff.

10 May 2008 (PR):
    - API: Moving enthought/mayavi/engine.py ->
      enthought/mayavi/core/engine.py where it really belongs; see
      [18667].

7,8 May 2008 (PR):
    - API: The plugins_e3 package is now moved into plugins.  This
      breaks the enthought.tvtk.plugins API and also the
      enthought.mayavi.mayavi_*_definition modules.  The older envisage2
      plugin code is all removed. See: [18649], [18650], [18651],
      [18652], [18655], [18657], [18662].

6 May 2008 (PR):
    - API: The enthought.mayavi.core.Base.confirm_delete class attribute
      is gone since it is no longer needed [18635].
    - API: Removed config directory, integrated all mlab preferences
      into the the mayavi preferences framework, see [18632].
      To get the preferences just do:
        from enthought.mayavi.preferences.api import preference_manager
      This is the preference manager that manages all prefs.  To see the
      code look in enthought.mayavi.preferences.preference_manager.  It
      is also a good idea to read the enthought.preferences
      documentation.
    - BUG: [18627] Fixed bug number 478844 on the Debian BTS here:
      http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=478844 

4 May 2008 (PR):
    - API: Added to api.  Added a new preferences framework for mayavi2.
      This uses enthought.preferences and works well both standalone and
      with envisage3. It makes it easy to create/define/change
      preferences at the application and library level. 

2 May, 2008 (PR):
    - API: Ported the mayavi2 application and plugin to work with Envisage3.
      See changesets [18595] and [18598].  *This obviously breaks the
      plugin API completely!*
    - Got the mlab envisage_engine_manager working with new changes
      [18599].
