MayaVi2:
    - Core:
        - Better and correct persistence. (p)
        - Add a "remove_from_visualization" method on pipeline objects?

    - Sources:
        - Multiblock data support.
        - DataObjectManager to abstract what SetActiveAttribute does.
          It should also support using expressions to add new
          scalars/vectors etc.

    - Modules/Filters:
        
    - UI:
        - Right click on filter should allow you to save the output to
          a VTK XML file.
        - Make the viewer used in standalone more versatile (make it easy to
          control what goes on the toolbar and in the menus.
        - Easier access to the LUT editor.
        - Transfer editor for images. (g)
        - More preference options: disable splash screen, disable adder
          nodes,

    - Misc:
        - Cleaner approach for mayavi2 -x, use a decorator?
        - Support for animation.
        - Support for multiple renderers in a single scene.

    - Documentation:

    - Mlab:
        - mlab.show to start the GUI event-loop in a clever way (g).
	- add texture support to Mlab
